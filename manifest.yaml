  short: A Bitcoin Full Node by Bitcoin Core
  long: Bitcoin is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.

alerts:
  install: Notice! If Bitcoin ever gets stuck in "stopping" status, the solution is to restart your server. System -> Restart.
  uninstall: Uninstalling Bitcoin Core will result in permanent loss of data. Without a backup, any funds stored on your node's default hot wallet will be lost forever. If you are unsure, we recommend making a backup, just to be safe.
  restore: Restoring Bitcoin Core will overwrite its current data. You will lose any transactions recorded in watch-only wallets, and any funds you have received to the hot wallet, since the last backup.

actions:
  reindex:
    name: "Reindex Blockchain"
    description: "Rebuilds the block and chainstate databases starting from genesis. If blocks already exist on disk, these are used rather than being redownloaded. For pruned nodes, this means downloading the entire blockchain over again."
    warning: Blocks not stored on disk will be redownloaded in order to rebuild the database. If your node is pruned, this action is equivalent to syncing the node from scratch, so this process could take weeks on low-end hardware.

      io-format: json
  reindex-chainstate:
    name: "Reindex Chainstate"
    description: "Rebuilds the chainstate database using existing block index data; as the block index is not rebuilt, 'reindex_chainstate' should be strictly faster than 'reindex'. This action should only be used in the case of chainstate corruption; if the blocks stored on disk are corrupted, the 'reindex' action will need to be run instead."
    warning: While faster than 'Reindex', 'Reindex Chainstate' can still take several days or more to complete. Pruned nodes do not allow 'reindex-chainstate'; if you are running a pruned node and suspect chainstate corruption the 'reindex' action (requiring redownloading the entire Blockchain) should be run instead.
